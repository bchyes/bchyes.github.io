I’m a fourth year undergraduate student from from [**ACM Honor Class**](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/)(**SJTU**). My research interest includes theoretical computer science, especially **cryptography**.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Peihan Miao](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/pmiao) at Brown University. During my junior year, I was advised by Prof. Shengli Liu at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
