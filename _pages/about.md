I’m a fourth year undergraduate student from from [**ACM Honor Class**](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/)(**SJTU**). My research interest includes theoretical computer science, especially **cryptography**.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Peihan Miao](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/pmiao) at Brown University. During my junior year, I was advised by Prof. Shengli Liu at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

You can find my CV here: [Chenhao Bao’s Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV_Chenhao Bao_2.pdf).

## Research Experience

- Oct. 2023 – Sept. 2024: Member
    - Project name: **Biometric-Based Two-Factor Authentication and Key Generation**
    - Brief introduction: Developed a generic two-factor authenticated key exchange scheme that enhances security by achieving zero-knowledge properties and implemented quantum-resistant security.
    - Concrete work:
      - Studied aPAKE, digital signatures, and secure sketch in detail, and improved upon previous single-factor schemes based on aPAKE to design the current generic two-factor scheme.
      - Defined an enhanced security model that satisfies not only authentication and indistinguishability but also zero-knowledge properties, ensuring that public data, stored database information, and transcripts do not leak any sensitive biometric information.
      - Implemented quantum-resistant instantiations for each component, achieving a quantum-secure scheme, and analyzed the scheme's efficiency based on these instantiations.
    - The work is now submitted to ACNS.

- Mar. 2023 – Feb. 2024: Member
    - Project name: **Implementation and comparison of gas tracing algorithms for dual robots in confined space**
    - Brief introduction: The project aimed to trace gas leaks efficiently using robotic systems in constrained environments.
    - Concrete work:
      - Conducted a thorough investigation of existing algorithms, performing efficiency testing and comparisons within real-world simulation environments.
      - Developed and proposed an improved hybrid approach combining Whale Optimization Algorithm and E. coil Optimization Algorithm specifically for dual-vehicle scenarios.
